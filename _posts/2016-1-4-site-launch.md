I have finally figured out Github page hosting with Jekyll. I would like to thank [Barry Clark](http://www.barryclark.co/introducing-jekyll-now/) for his incredible walkthrough for using Jekyll Now as a static site generator. Additionally, I would like to acknowledge [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) as the author/creator of the Lanyon theme for Jekyll that is used by this site.
